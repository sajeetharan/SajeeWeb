# Sajeetharan Sinnathurai - Personal Website

This repository contains the source for [sajeetharan.dev](https://www.sajeetharan.dev).

## Development

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Toolchain

This project uses [Volta](https://github.com/volta-cli/volta) to manage the NodeJS version. Volta automatically downloads and installs the right Node.js version when you run any of the `node` or `npm` commands. Therefore, it is recommended to install it before developing this project to ensure the right Node.js version is used.

### Installation

```
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

The static site is deployed from `main` with GitHub Pages. The optional
Cloudflare Worker serves negotiated Markdown responses from the same build.

To deploy the Worker, configure `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and
`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` as GitHub Actions secrets, then dispatch **Deploy
Cloudflare Worker**. To publish the CLI, configure `NPM_TOKEN`, increment the
version in `cli/package.json`, and dispatch **Publish CLI**.
