Principal Product Manager with 13 years of experience in the software industry, including 4 years in product management and 9 years as a developer specializing in cloud platforms. Iâ€™m passionate about creating tools that empower developers, with a strong focus on developer experience and database solutions.

Outside of work, I'm deeply involved in the tech community. Over the past decade, I've been the top Stack Overflow contributor from Sri Lanka and ranked in the global top 10 for Azure, Angular, and Azure Cosmos DB. As the first Google Developer Expert and Microsoft MVP in developer technologies from Sri Lanka, I actively contribute to open-source projects and speak at conferences worldwide.
