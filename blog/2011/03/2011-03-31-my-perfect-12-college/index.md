[![](https://sajeetharan.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/79251-4.png?w=300)](https://sajeetharan.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/79251-4.png) Life’s not that easy I know, Things never go in the way we think so. But still being a part of all that goes, Make me feel I’m special and it really shows. This is because I found my new family, In my friends whom I met in college, coincidently. Being far away from family, You can’t always be happy. First day in college, Stranger’s I met, As if all the varieties in a single set. I chose the friends of mine, With a logo and a perfect sign. We were twelve and all of different kinds, And I name the group” The Perfect 12”. Initial perfect 12 members are as follows, And all the heads are shallow.

Shyam- Though the shortest of all, but the smartest we call.

Rajesh- “The jaan of the group”, the funniest one in the troop.

Sathish Ramachandran- “The angry young man”, but always the helping hand.

Rajendra - The one who everyone respects, play safely and overview all the aspects.

K.sathish - “Ching chong hong”, he is crazy about this song.

Aparajitha - A perfect combination of “Mature without brain”, but times spent with her never goes in vain.

Venkatesh- The dashing dude of the class, “who always secure pass”.

Sujitha - The most friendly and dearest to me, her possesiveness makes me “tumble and fall”.

J.S - One who was always with me! His girl name ends with "thee"

Sandy we call programmer! His Best friend is the queen of grammar!

Prem- The handsome and experienced one! who creates troubles to none!

Now the branch separates , And the members also somehow changes. This is what Perfect 12 is full of, And the rest all “Shut Off "
