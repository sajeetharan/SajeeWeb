This is a poem written by Sir Walter Scott ,I would like to share with you all. Many might have encountered this when you were in school. This has created a lasting impression in my mind.

  

There could be no girl who doesn’t go fascinated with fairy tales, princes, princesses. Cindrella, sleeping beauty, snow white, Beauty and the beast and what not in this genre must have definitely stimulated dreams of a prince coming some day in his horse and fleeing with you as his bride. I agree even I had those expectations and I would say I was even waiting for such a thing in my life to occur. There is nothing to get embarrassed about this feeling to share openly as I am sure every second girl must have gone past this looking at her front door waiting for her prince.

Well this poem was read by my teacher when I was in the 7th. She is an excellent teacher, she will draw our complete attention towards what she is teaching by dramatising every line of a poem.

This poem rather a ballad, is about Lochinvar the hero, who is a fearless young Scott coming across the border from Scotland to England, snatches the English Lord’s daughter, fair Ellen and boldly rides back with her to Scotland.

The poet brings out a splendid pen portrayal of Lochinvar and his lady love, Ellen.The two lines of the poem “None but the brave deserves the fair” and “Faint heart never won fair lady” simply finishes the poem bottomline.

Lochinvar is a gallant and a dauntless young Scott, faithful in his love with Ellen. Determined to win over Ellen, he crosses the boundary between England and Scotland, swims across river Eske and reaches the Netherby Gate. But the bride Ellen is consented to a laggard in love and a dastard in war. Ellen's father is giving Ellen in marriage to another guy of his choice.

On seeing Lochinvar the brides father asks him whether he has come to fight or to make peace. Lochinvar answer saying that his proposal is denied and informs he has come only for a cup of wine and to dance with the bride. He says

**“Love swells like the Solway , but ebbs like its tide,**

**And now I am come, with this lost love of mine.”**

The tidal waves in Solway Firth rises and sinks swiftly, likewise love if not encouraged will sink with equal swiftness.

In this way Lochinvar misleads the English lord and confidently convinces the Lord that there are many young women who are lovelier than Ellen gladly to be the bride to him.

The bride Ellen kisses the goblet and Lochinvar drinks it in a single gulp and throws it down. Ellen stands embarrassed with a smile in her lips and a tear in her eye. Lochinvar then takes her soft hand and they dance so elegantly in a form that everyone gathered there think Nether by hall has never graced such a beautiful couple. Ellens mother frets and her father fumes at the sight. Here and there people whisper there could be no better match for Ellen than young daring Lochinvar.

In the course of dancing Lochinvar and Ellen reach the hall door. Lochinvar whispers into Ellen’s ears. Then he swings Ellen onto his horse back and springs up after her triumphantly exclaiming ‘she is won’. He continues to ridewith Ellen at great speed over bank, bush and scaur.although the bride’s kinsman jointly chase themon Cannobie Lee, the lost bride of Netherby never did the see.

The poet simply celebrates the courage and true love of a gallant.
