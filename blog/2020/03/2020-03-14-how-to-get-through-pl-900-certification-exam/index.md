In general, any certification offers practical experience to individuals from all the aspects to be a proficient worker.Certified professionals have more beneficial and relevant networks that help them in setting career goals for themselves.Since last year I concentrated on the different Azure certifications. This year I have have a target to complete certifications on different areas too. As a start for this year, i did the certification PL-900 today and i would say it is one of the easiest exam if you have prior experience in building Mobile applications and have a general idea on how to solve business problems.

## Microsoft's Power Platform

Microsoft's Power Platform is a low code platform (an environment with graphical user interfaces rather than traditional scripts and programming languages) powered by Microsoft Azure (the cloud computing platform) enabling organisations to analyse data from multiple sources, act on it through created applications and automate business processes.he Power Platform contains 3 key aspects ([Power Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps), [Power BI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi),[Power Virtual Agents](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-virtual-agents/), and [Power Automate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate)) and integrates with 2 main ecosystems (Office 365 and Dynamics 365).

## PL-900: Microsoft Power Platform Fundamentals

Last year November the new [PL-900: Microsoft Power Platform Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/exams/pl-900) was released in Beta mode and it's recently went into generally available.

After reading the "Skills Measured" section, I realized that a lot of what I have implemented in the past as a developer and i had some experience with PowerBI as well.

Based on the content , i was confident enough to take the exam but I wanted to make sure I was completely prepared for the exam on the topics which i am not familiar with, so did some learning on [Dynamics 365 on Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/learn-business-value-of-dynamics-365-and-power-platform-v1-1/?WT.mc_id=techielass-blog-salean) and the [Common Data Service (CDS) on Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/get-started-cds) as well.

## Exam Materials and Tips:

You need to only spent 3-4 hours reviewing the Learning Path of Power Platform Fundamentals if you are already familiar with the topics. It's a pretty straight forward exam for which if you read the course on Microsoft Learn, you should be good to go. If you are aware of all the components of the **Power** **Platform**, you probably can give the exam as is.

**Released:** 4th November 2019 (GA 18/02/2020)  
**MS Learn:** [Modules available](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/power-plat-fundamentals/)

I would request anyone preparing for PL-900 to have a good grasp of the following subjects:

- Common Data Service
- Difference between Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service
- Power Apps Portals
- AI Builder Models
- Difference between Business Rules and Business Process Flows
- How Power Platform works with Dynamics 365

It is not a hard exam if you are from the developer background, however get well prepared for this one! As always get hands on. Let’s be citizen developers together. Cheers!
