Since the acquisition by Microsoft, Github been so much better! They have added so many new features, made mobile app. GitHub recently made lot of improvements on the UI aspects including adding a twitter handle to your profile. Also introduced a special feature for developers, that allows you to showcase yourself by pinning a¬†`README.md`¬†containing information about you, your work, portfolio and anything else on your GitHub profile.

In this post, I'll show you how to create a rocking Github profile to showcase your skills when someone visits your profile

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- Basic markdown knowledge
- Expertise on Making Gifs would be an added advantage

**Step 1 :**

Create a new¬†[‚ú®special‚ú® repository](https://github.com/new)¬†with your username. The special repository is case sensitive, ensure to use the same case as your account's username.

**Step 2 :**

Click on the checkbox: **"Initialize this repository with a README"**. This will create a `README.md` file inside your `<Username>/<Username>` repository, where you will be adding the details.

This is definitely a great feature for developers to expose their skills and also to showcase to recruiters, followers etc. I would ask everyone to get creative and showcase everything about yourself to your frollowers
