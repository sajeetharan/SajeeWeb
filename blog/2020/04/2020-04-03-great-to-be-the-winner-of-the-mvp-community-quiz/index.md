Before joining with Microsoft, I have been a Microsoft MVP continuously for 2 years that gave me the opportunity to meet so many experts across the world and get to know them and the communities. The quiz mainly covered the questions among the interesting facts about famous MVPs and the community events.

**üèÜ Among the winners!**

It's great to be listed among the winners as there were participants from 23 countries around the world.
