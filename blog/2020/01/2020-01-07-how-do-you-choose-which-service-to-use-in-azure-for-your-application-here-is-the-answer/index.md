If you have been using Azure already or new to Azure, you must know that Microsoft Azure is huge and it changes very fast with new services and updates. It can be really overwhelming to see the new releases,features at the same time it is very hard to know which services to use for the given scenario of your application.

I have been working with few customers and partners and i have a method that i use to help me to pick the right compute service on azure. This helps me to narrow down the services to choose from and pick the right one for the solution. The following decision tree helps you to decide which service to pick

I also have implemented a visulization to depict the above picture using a tool which you can access from [Azure360](http://azure360.info/).

Have fun and pick the right service to build your next solution.
