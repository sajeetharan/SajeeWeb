So here i am again just concluded an awesome 2019, and over the last two years I've done a "Year in Review" blog post and I want to do another for this year. Some pretty awesome stuff happened to me in the year 2019. 

### Summary of the year 2019

- Recieved Tech Leadership Award at 99X Technology
- Joined Microsoft's APAC OCP Team
- Delivered 20+ Sessions, 5+ Workshops and attended 5 conferences
- Wrote 20+ blogs on Azure and Angular
- Contributed to OpenFaaS
- Attended First ever Microsoft Ready, Google IO, Google Developer Expert Summit
- Completed 3 Microsoft Certifications and Became a Microsoft Certified Trainer
- Achieved 150,000 Reputation on Stackoverflow
- Reviewed a book on Angular named "Angular Projects"
- Created tool named Azure 360 to support new beginners on Azure

### Career

I started off 2019 continuing as a Senior Tech Lead at 99X technology and in January i recieved the "Technology Leadership award" and it was a proud moment in my career. However in March I made the switch to join the Microsoft APAC One Commercial Partner team as a Technology Evangelist . It was one of the best career decision i've made as it is a totally different role from what i've been doing earlier. Within 10 months at Microsoft, I managed to complete 3 certifications including Microsoft Azure Solution Architect, Microsoft Azure Developer Associate and Microsoft Certified Trainer respectively. I love how I‘m constantly challenged, knowing I have full support of my manager and my team at this role.

## Blogging

Last year i migrated my blog from blogspot to wordpress and since then i have been actively writing new posts on Angular and Azure atleast once a month, this year it's around about the 50 mark. I have got totally 15000 views in this year and around 50 new followers which is a great thing which eventually made my blog as one of the [top Azure site](https://blog.feedspot.com/microsoft_azure_blogs/) to follow in 2020.

## Sessions,Workshops and conferences

2019 has been the best year for me in terms of speaking opportunities and attending conferences. I almost visited 7 different countries in 2019 while i attended my first ever Microsoft Ready in July, Google IO in May and Google Developer Expert Summit in October. Apart from that i have spoken at 20+ meetups on various topics, 4 conferences including Google DevFest and Azure bootcamp in [India,Nepal and Pakistan](https://www.rateevent.com/speakers/sajeetharansinnathurai). Also visited to Nepal,Indonesia to conduct workshops, Trainings on Azure. One of the highight in 2019 was that as a organizer i managed to organize th[e first ever Angular conference](https://www.facebook.com/ngslconf) in Srilanka with over 400+ participants.

## Publications,Stackoverflow and Github Contributions

Last year i managed to work on 2 books on Angular as a technical reviewer namely Angular 8 and [Angular Projects](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/angular-projects) which eventually became the best selling book on Packt.com. Also i managed to make it to the top 420 users in the world on stackoverflow as well as reached [150k reputation.](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1749403/sajeetharan) Also published around 25+ code samples on [Github](https://github.com/sajeetharan) during 2019.
