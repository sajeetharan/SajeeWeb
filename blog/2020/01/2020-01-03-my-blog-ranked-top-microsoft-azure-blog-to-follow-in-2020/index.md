What a way to start the new year 2020!. It just began and I am feeling as I've achieved something. It is always great when you are being recognized for your hard work and dedication. A growing list of subscribers and ever increasing traffic stats are pretty awesome! However, for the first time in my career to be ranked among the Microsoft Azure blog to follow in 2020 is truly amazing! Today, Feed spot published their list of the [Top 50 Microsoft Azure Blogs to follow in 2020](https://blog.feedspot.com/microsoft_azure_blogs/) and i was surprised to see my name in the spot number #27.

While i am honored to be in that list, I would recommend and it’s also important to note all the other great blogs on the list too. Take a moment to check out the list and browse through all the other great blogs on the Top 50 list as well. Congratulations everyone, the azure community wouldn’t be what it is without each of you; in addition to the countless other blogs that didn’t make the list.

"I**f you have knowledge, let others light their candle in it"**

Thanks Feedspot and everyone for the support ! I’m sure we’ll be seeing each other next year as well.
