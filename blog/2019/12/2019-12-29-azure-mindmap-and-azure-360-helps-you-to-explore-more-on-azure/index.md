Are you an Azure or Cloud enthusiast? Got a resolution to learn [#Azure](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?highlightedUpdateUrns=urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6616654176497823744&keywords=%23Azure&originTrackingId=jSzdquiDS%2BSyyztiL9ol4Q%3D%3D) in 2020?. I recently read a [wonderful blog](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2019/12/how-to-learn-microsoft-azure-in-2020/) by [@ThomasMaurer](https://twitter.com/ThomasMaurer) . Immediately i wanted to create visualization to make all the resouces in one place so that i will be easy for everyone to access. On the following days i created two resources namely,

[Azure 360:](https://azure360.azurewebsites.net/)

It is a simple [D3 Force visualization](https://azure360.azurewebsites.net/) that has all the Resources to learn Azure in a single page

[Azure Mind-Map:](https://github.com/sajeetharan/azure-mindmap)

It is a [github repositor](https://github.com/sajeetharan/azure-mindmap)y which contains all the mind-maps related to Azure resources,technologies and certifications. In general, Creating a best Azure architecture and making sure all aspects of design, development,release and maintainance can be very difficult. Microsoft Azure team have published their own set of best practices and frameworks for building cloud solutions on [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/). I have created/obtained these mindmaps from various resources built by others as well as i have modified few. Source of information used to create the illustrations are the resources of the Azure team.
