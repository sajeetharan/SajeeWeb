I have been answering questions on Stackoverflow since 2011, and recently i started answering questions on #Azure. I was amazed to see the growth of Azure in the last 3 years among developers which is almost 200%. More the questions means more are implementing solutions on Azure.

I just checked the growing trends of different cloud provides including #AWS and #GCP , you can see the growth of Azure in the image below.

As i mentioned in the newsletter recently published by Trident(Cloud solution provider) Azure is becoming the Cloud that developers love the most in recent times.
