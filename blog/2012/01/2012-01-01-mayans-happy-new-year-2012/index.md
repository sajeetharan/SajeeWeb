That is a POSITIVE ATTITUDE , but  we have to Respect  Great Civilization...!!

  

We entered the year with baby steps,

Ending it with a weary trudge.

So much has happened,

Just in a year’s time.

  

A year of growth and learning,

A year of bitter and sweet,

A year of old and new,

A year to place in our Wall of life.

  

Now a new book is waiting,

It's pages pure and white.

New baby steps again,

A New Year to write.

  

This little poem comes with a wish,

That your New Year will be bright.

That it's pages will be filled,

With memories of much delight.
