**Business Intelligence and It's impacts:**  
  
Hello! I am back, after what I realized was my first extended blog break in four years. This time something technical, which is very much relevant to the product which i am currently working on. First of all, what is Business Intelligence?  It is the process, tools and infrastructure for generating insights from raw data is collectively called Business Intelligence.  
  
Every organization generates data as part of its operations. Every organization also has access to some form of external data. But in order to analyze and take informed decisions, the data has to be processed and turned into information, and the information has to be presented in a meaningful way to be able to identify patterns or to see key performance indicators (KPIs), and thereby generate insights out of the information.            
  
This blog mainly describes the importance of BI in an insurance industry since i have to do my final project  where a BI solution can be used and come up with a solution with a collection of tools.
